# Geeky Exchange

## Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app / Why is it a problem that needs solving?
This marketplace is aiming to solve the problem of when searching for pop culture goods, there are many places to look. The websites that sell these goods are usually new goods in the case of businesses or places like the Facebook Marketplace were second hand/pre-owned goods are found. By using my marketplace app (Geeky Exchange) the new goods sold by businesses and the second hand goods can be combined into one place. This makes the search easier and payments are processed in one place.
